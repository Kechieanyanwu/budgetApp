Welcome to the Envelope Budgeting Application!

This is a budgeting application which allows you to manage your finances based on the "Envelope budgeting" system. With this approach, you allocate specific amounts of money to various expense categories, represented by distinct "Envelopes." This method ensures that your spending aligns with your financial goals and priorities.

Key Features:
1. Get started with three predefined Envelopes: Food, Bills, and Tithe.
2. Note that any additional Envelopes you create will be reset upon server restarts.


How to Get Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local folder.
2. Open your terminal and run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the server by running "npm run start." The server automatically restarts upon saving, thanks to "nodemon."
4. For manual server restart control, use "node server.js" instead.
5. Begin interacting with the application's diverse endpoints as outlined in the API documentation available here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28439027/2s9Xy5NrB9.
