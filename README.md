Envelope Budgeting application.

WIP.

How to run:

Notes: 
- I am tailoring this envelope budgeting application to my personal needs. Broad categories will include: 
    - Bills
    - Food
    - Transportation
    - Shopping
    - Saving
    - Gifts

To-Do / Questions / Thoughts / Scratch space
- Get amount starting each month with
- How are items being split?
- Include validation for amount in envelope
- Should there be a list of all the envelopes returned?
- When income is recorded, softwar should distribute a portion to each envelop
- When purchase is made, software should deduct from the respective envelop
- Should there be a create envelop function / endpoint? 


Project Objectives:

Build an API using Node.js and Express
Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
Create endpoint(s) to update envelope balances
Use Git version control to keep track of your work
Use the command line to navigate your files and folders
Use Postman to test API endpoints
